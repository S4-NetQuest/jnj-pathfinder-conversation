Q1:
Are you willing to deviate from mechanical axis (0° HKA)?
Answers:
	Yes (+1 KA / +1 iKA / +1 FA )
	No (+2 MA)

Q2:
What is your primary goal when performing Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA)?
Answers:
	Aiming for a neutral mechanical alignment (0° HKA) (+2 MA)
	Restoring the patient’s native alignment to its pre-disease state (+2 KA)
	Prioritizing balanced flexion and extension gaps (+2 FA)

Q3:
What is your preferred surgical workflow?
Answers:
	Femur-first (+2 KA)
	Tibia-first (+2 iKA)

Q4:
When you're performing the distal femoral resection, what are you aiming to achieve?
Answers:
	Soft tissue balance by adjusting the cut within defined boundaries (+1 FA / +1 iKA)
	A cut that is perpendicular to the mechanical axis of the femur (+2 MA)
	Restoration of native joint line obliquity– the femoral resection is positioned to restore the joint line to the patient's pre-arthritic anatomy (+2 KA)

Q5:
When you're performing the tibial resection, what are you aiming to achieve?
Answers:
	Adjust the cut within boundaries to help balance the flexion and extension gaps (+1 FA / +1 iKA)
	Make the cut perpendicular to the mechanical axis of the tibia (+2 MA)
	Restoration of the native joint line obliquity based on the patient's pre-arthritic anatomy (+2 KA)

Q6:
When balancing extension gaps, the priority is:
Answers:
	Minimize tibial varus -prioritizes neutral tibia, adjusts femur component to balance extension gaps (+2 MA)
	Minimize femoral joint line deviation–prioritizes native femur joint line, adjusts tibia component to balance gaps (+2 KA)
	Evenly distribute changes to femur/tibia –prioritizes neutral femur and tibia, splits varus/valgus adjustments between both components to balance gaps (+2 FA)

Q7:
The posterior femoral resection should:
Answers:
	Restore both medial and lateral posterior condylar offsets– both medial and lateral posterior resections aim to recreate the pre-arthritic posterior condylar offset (+2 KA)
	Restore medial posterior condylar offset and use lateral resection to balance– the medial posterior resection recreates the pre-arthritic medial posterior condylar offset, and the lateral posterior resection is used to balance gaps (+2 iKA)
	Use both medial and lateral resections to balance– both medial and lateral posterior resections are used to balance gaps to obtain the intended ligament tension (+2 FA)

Q8:
Do you apply coronal boundaries (limits to deviation)?
Answers:
	Yes (+1 iKA / +1 FA)
	No (+2 KA)
