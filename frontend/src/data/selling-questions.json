    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "If we could offer a way to restore native kinematics while still achieving excellent implant survivorship, would that be worth exploring further?",

      "id": 6,
      "question": "Have you explored using the CPAK (Coronal Plane Alignment of the Knee) classification system to better understand your patient's native alignment pattern before surgery?",
      "answer": "Introduces a personalized classification approach that highlights natural alignment variations, challenging the idea of \"one size fits all\" in MA.",
      "categories": ["Teach", "Constructive Tension"]
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "Do you find the CPAK classification groupings helpful in identifying patients who may not benefit from standard mechanical alignment?",
      "answer": "Reinforces how CPAK can support more personalized planning and predict intraoperative adjustments.",

    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "Do you typically assess or estimate the Medial Proximal Tibial Angle (MPTA) when determining your tibial resection?",
      "answer": "Encourages reflection on whether they preserve or override natural tibial joint line. Ties directly to KA/iKA vs MA distinction.",
      "categories": ["Teach", "Constructive Tension"]
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "In your workflow, how do you handle situations where extension and flexion gaps don't match—do you favor femoral or tibial adjustments?",
      "answer": "Opens opportunity to expose mechanical alignment shortcomings (challenging MA subtly).",
      "categories": ["Constructive Tension"]
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "Do you consider achieving equal flexion and extension gaps a top priority, even if it means accepting 1-2mm of lateral laxity in flexion?",
      "answer": "Helps identify surgeons using Functional Alignment, where gap balance is primary—even over strict restoration of anatomy.",
      "categories": ["Teach", "Know the Customer's World"]

    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "What role does gap balancing play in your procedure—do you aim for symmetrical medial/lateral gaps in flexion and extension?",
      "answer": "Educates that symmetrical gaps may tie more closely to iKA principles; personalizes based on balancing philosophy.",
      "categories": ["Teach", "Tailor"]
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "Do you prioritize the Lateral Distal Femoral Angle (LDFA) preoperatively or intraoperatively?",
      "answer": "Highlights importance of understanding native femoral alignment and how KA aims to restore this rather than override it with a neutral axis.",
